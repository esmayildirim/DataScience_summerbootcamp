    "\n",
    "In this case study, we are going to create a `mysql` database instance using `RDS` service and another instance to connect to it using `EC2` service. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional materials: \n",
    "- drugs_product.csv\n",
    "- drugs_package.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have an RDS and an EC2 instance up and running, go to Step 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step1: Create two security groups.\n",
    "- rds-security-group: will be assigned to RDS instance. This security group must have an inbound rule allowing MySQL/Aurora connection on port 3306. It should be set so that the security group of the EC2 instance (rds-ec2-security) can connect to it to ensure security. \n",
    "\n",
    "- rds-ec2-security-group: will be assigned to EC2 instance. This security group must have two inbound rules. The first one must allow SSH connection on port 22 from MyIP only. The second rule must allow MySQL/Aurora connection on port 3306 to only rds-security-group. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we can connect to EC2 instance from outside and the EC2 instance can connect to RDS instance only. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step2: Create RDS database. \n",
    "- Create a database with database instance id, username and password. If you want to create a database, it can be done if you give a database name. \n",
    "- The VPC, subnet and availability zones must the the same as EC2 instance. \n",
    "- The database name: drugsdb\n",
    "- Assign rds-security-group as the security group of the instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step3: Create EC2 instance.\n",
    "- Use the default parameters to create an EC2 instance. \n",
    "- Assign rds-ec2-security-group as the security group of the instance. "
