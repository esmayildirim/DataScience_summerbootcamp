    "<b>Instructions for Sandbox</b>\n",
    "- Create two security groups under Work VPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "- rds-security-group: will be assigned to RDS instance. This security group must have an inbound rule allowing MySQL/Aurora connection on port 3306. It should be set so that the security group of the EC2 instance (rds-ec2-security) can connect to it to ensure security. \n",

    "- rds-ec2-security-group: will be assigned to EC2 instance. This security group must have two inbound rules. The first one must allow SSH connection on port 22 from MyIP only. The second rule must allow MySQL/Aurora connection on port 3306 to only rds-security-group. \n",

    "- The VPC, subnet and availability zones must the the same as EC2 instance. \n",
    "- The database name: bookdb\n",
