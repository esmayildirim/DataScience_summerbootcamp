    "In this exercise, we will analyze the tweets and user mentions text data and measure `polarity` and `subjectivity`. Python's `textblob` module has objects that can measure polarity and subjectivity in a text. Polarity is a number between -1 and 1. If the measure gives a positive number then the sentiment of the text is mostly positive. Otherwise, it is negative. A value of 0 shows neutral sentiment. Subjectivity is a number between 0 and 1. 0 refers to being objective while 1 refers to being subjective.\n",
